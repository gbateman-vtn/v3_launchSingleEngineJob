mutation createTDO {
  createTDO(
    input: {
      startDateTime: "2019-04-24T21:49:04.412Z",
      stopDateTime: "2019-04-24T21:50:04.412Z"
    }
  )
  {
    id
  }
}



The startDateTime and stopDateTime values are required, but can be dummy values. The only firm requirements are that the values exist, and that the second value is greater than the first (but not by more than a year). You can supply an integer here (milliseconds), or any ISO-8601-legal string. E.g. "20190424T174428Z" and "2019-04-24T21:49:04.412Z" are both acceptable string values.

Set the TDO's addToIndex field to false if you want to disable automatic indexing of TDO assets for purposes of Search.

A successful response will look like:

{
  "data": {
    "createTDO": {
      "id": "460907869"
    }
  }
}
